          An Open Graph (OG) image is the image social networks (such as Twitter
          and Facebook) pull from your website to create a preview when someone
          shares a link to your website.

        <p className="leading-relaxed tracking-wide">
          Regardless of the effectiveness of a post title or the quality of the
          actual post content, an OG image is usually the first thing people
          notice about a shared post as they browse their feed.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed tracking-wide">
          In theory, a better OG image should increase how often people click
          through to your website and re-share the original shared post.

          Cloudinary is primarily an image hosting service and CDN. On top of
          their incredible CDN they also provide a powerful REST image
          manipulation and generation API. Think of it as a simplified URL-based
          Figma or Photoshop: you provide arguments as URL paths and it
          generates, caches, and returns an image file.
